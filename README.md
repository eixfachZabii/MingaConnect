# Minga Connect ðŸ’›ðŸ¥¨ - HackaTUM 2024 Project

On November 22-24, 2024, our team participated in the HackaTUM Hackathon in Munich. 
Inspired by the City of Munich's challenge to address loneliness and foster community connections,
we proudly presented our project Minga Connect.

## Project Challenge

### Problem

Munich is a vibrant city with 1.6 million residents. However, data shows:

- 30.5% of households are single-person, with limited interaction.
- One in four Germans feels lonely, which has severe health implications.
- There's a pressing need for solutions to foster social interactions across all demographics.
- Our challenge was to design a smart, new, innovative, and valuable solution that addresses loneliness, fosters connection, and works as a responsive MVP for real-world implementation.

### Vision

**Minga Connect** aims to:
- **Strengthen Communities**: Bring people together by creating opportunities for shared experiences.
- **Combat Loneliness**: Help people connect in meaningful ways across different demographics.
- **Promote Inclusion**: Ensure everyone feels welcome, regardless of background or interests.
- **Enhance Local Engagement**: Encourage participation in Munichâ€™s vibrant cultural and social life.
- **Supports inclusivity**: Support across different age groups, cultures, and living situations.
