On November 22-24, 2024, our team participated in the HackaTUM Hackathon in Munich. 
Inspired by the City of Munich's challenge to address loneliness and foster community connections,
we proudly presented our project Minga Connect.

**Minga Connect** is a community-driven platform designed to connect individuals based on shared interests and activities, bridging generational and cultural gaps while **combating loneliness**. Our responsive MVP provides an intuitive and scalable solution to help residents of Munich, especially those living alone or new to the city, to feel more connected.

Project Goal
To create a platform that:

Fosters community connections through shared activities and interests.
Addresses loneliness by encouraging meaningful interactions.
Supports inclusivity across different age groups, cultures, and living situations.

## Project Challenge

Munich is a vibrant city with 1.6 million residents. However, data shows:

- 30.5% of households are single-person, with limited interaction.
- One in four Germans feels lonely, which has severe health implications.
- There's a pressing need for solutions to foster social interactions across all demographics.
- Our challenge was to design a smart, new, innovative, and valuable solution that addresses loneliness, fosters connection, and works as a responsive MVP for real-world implementation.
